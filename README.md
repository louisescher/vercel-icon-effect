# Vercel Icon Effect

This repository is a small proof-of-concept showing how a hover effect from [Vercel's website](https://vercel.com) could be replicated. All code can be found in `src/pages/index.astro` and is sufficiently commented for your understanding. If you want to see a preview of the effect, head to [the preview page](https://louisescher.github.io/vercel-icon-effect).
